a napari plugin for anatomical segmentation of general cellular images

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using with [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

The plugin code was written by Carsen Stringer, and the cellpose code was written by Carsen Stringer and Marius Pachitariu. To learn about Cellpose, read the [**paper**](https://t.co/kBMXmPp3Yn?amp=1) or watch this [**talk**](https://t.co/JChCsTD0SK?amp=1). 

For support with the plugin, please open an [issue](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose-napari/issues). For support with cellpose, please open an [issue](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose/issues) on the cellpose repo. 


If you use this plugin please cite the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01018-x):

![cellpose-napari_plugin](https://cellpose-napari.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/napari_main_demo_fast_small.gif?raw=true "cellpose-napari")

## Installation

Install an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python -- Choose **Python 3** and your operating system. Note you might need to use an anaconda prompt if you did not add anaconda to the path.

Install `napari` with pip: `pip install napari[all]`. Then install `cellpose-napari` via [pip]:

    pip install cellpose-napari
    
 Or install the plugin inside napari in the plugin window.

If install fails in your base environment, create a new environment:
1. Download the [`environment.yml`](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose-napari/blob/master/environment.yml?raw=true) file from the repository. You can do this by cloning the repository, or copy-pasting the text from the file into a text document on your local computer.
2. Open an anaconda prompt / command prompt with `conda` for **python 3** in the path
3. Change directories to where the `environment.yml` is and run `conda env create -f environment.yml`
4. To activate this new environment, run `conda activate cellpose_napari`
5. You should see `(cellpose_napari)` on the left side of the terminal line. 

If you have **issues** with cellpose installation, see the [cellpose docs](https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for more details, and then if the suggestions fail, open an issue.

### Upgrading software

You can upgrade the plugin with
~~~
pip install cellpose-napari --upgrade
~~~

and you can upgrade cellpose with
~~~
pip install cellpose --upgrade
~~~

### GPU version (CUDA) on Windows or Linux

If you plan on running many images, you may want to install a GPU version of *torch* (if it isn't already installed).

Before installing the GPU version, remove the CPU version:
~~~
pip uninstall torch
~~~

Follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to determine what version to install. The Anaconda install is recommended along with CUDA version 10.2. For instance this command will install the 10.2 version on Linux and Windows (note the `torchvision` and `torchaudio` commands are removed because cellpose doesn't require them):

~~~
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
~~~~

When upgrading GPU Cellpose in the future, you will want to ignore dependencies (to ensure that the pip version of torch does not install):
~~~
pip install --no-deps cellpose --upgrade
~~~

### Installation of github version

Follow steps from above to install the dependencies. In the github repository, run `pip install -e .` and the github version will be installed. If you want to go back to the pip version of cellpose-napari, then say `pip install cellpose-napari`.


## Running the software


Open napari with the cellpose-napari dock widget open
```
napari -w cellpose-napari
```

There is sample data in the File menu, or get started with your own images!
